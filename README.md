# ffneuralnet
This is a feedforward neural network written from scratch as a learning exercise. It takes the display reference of a 7-segment display as input and fits it to the binary representation of the number it's displaying.

main.cpp is the first version of this implementation. It was written as I was first learning about both neural networks and coding.

ffnn2.py is another implementation, written years later in python using numpy.
